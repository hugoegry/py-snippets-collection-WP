# py-snippets-collection-WP

A curated collection of small, independent Python snippets.  
Each snippet is self-contained and focuses on demonstrating a concept, solving a small problem, or experimenting with Python features.

ðŸš€ **Why this repo?**  
- To explore Python without the pressure of building a full project.  
- To share useful tricks, utilities, and experiments.  
- To serve as a quick reference or inspiration for future projects.  

ðŸ“‚ **Structure**  
- Each snippet lives in its own file (or folder if needed).  
- Snippets are independent â€” no hidden dependencies between them.  
- Naming is explicit so you can quickly find what youâ€™re looking for.   

âš¡ **Note**  
This repo is intentionally eclectic â€” it's a playground, not a framework.  
Use the snippets as inspiration, adapt them to your needs, and donâ€™t hesitate to improve them.
